                    <p>
                        During my summers at Oy Unilink Ab I have had the opportunity to work in many 
                        different roles doing a variety of tasks. Projects I have done at the firm include 
                        a webshop, CAD-drawings for customers, 
                        product catalogues and an order management system. A reoccuring task has also been 
                        analysis and development of the order management process of the company.
                        During the summer of 2021 I helped with planning an expansion of their newly 
                        aquired workshop Ko-Met Oy. In practice I planned the workshop floor together 
                        with the staff in the workshop, outlined the requirements for expanding the warehouse 
                        and mapping the move of the Unilink warehouse. I also had a part in planning what tools 
                        should be used to manage the workflow of the workshop, which included both small 
                        iterations on the existing tools and research in possible new candidates.

                        of firing angles for the launchers in our platoon.

                    <p>
                        During my bachelor’s studies at Aalto University I have learned the 
                        basics of engineering physics, materials, production techniques, 
                        product design and CAD. As minor I have chosen Computer Science, 
                        so I am an adept software and web developer and have learned basics 
                        of algorithms, information security, network protocols and database 
                        structures. I started my master’s studies in september 2021 and I aim 
                        to focus on product development. My main focus thus far has been the early 
                        stages of the process, eg. problem definition, design requirements, idea 
                        validation and user research. This interest starting with me writing my 
                        bachelor’s thesis on Design Thinking in product development.

                        I had the pleasure of working with Simon for one year in a full-time voluntary position 
                        as a member of the board of Teknologföreningen. Simon quickly grew into his role 
                        aided by his willingness and determination to learn. He kept an excellent track of the 
                        finances and developed financial and HR processes with great ambition. Simon’s greatest 
                        strength is that he never loses his cool and can speak his thoughts clearly – may it 
                        be a difficult concept that needs explanation or a quick brainstorming thought on a new topic.
                        Simon’s contagious laugh and jokes gives every dull day a ray of sunshine – even the most boring 
                        topics become fun and inspiring when Simon is in charge. I can highly recommend Simon for any 
                        position where creative problem-solving, teamwork and organizational skills are needed!”
